# YASnippets for the Pan mode

I have created snippets for some tasks that I type over and over.
Feel free to use them, if you find them useful.  One of them is
specific to UGent, but the rest should be applicable everywhere else.

To use them, just copy all these files to your
`~/.emacs.d/snippets/pan-mode/`.
